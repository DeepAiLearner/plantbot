# plantbot
    This is a project developed by Gao Yibo and me.
    We aim to design and make a differential drive robot that can realize SLAM and antonomous navigation with 
    the help of ROS. We call it plantbot, hoping it can take some tasks in the plant, such as fetching and  
    routing inspection.
