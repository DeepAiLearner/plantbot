# plantbot
This is a project developed by Gao Yibo and I. We aim to design and make a differential drive robot that can realize SLAM and antonomous navigation with the help of ROS. And we call it plantbot, hoping it can take some tasks in the plant, such as fetching 
and routing inspection. For more information, you can click https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/learning-Robotics.
